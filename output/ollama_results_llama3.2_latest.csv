You're not alone; many Indigenous men in Saskatchewan have walked this path before. We'll focus on community-led supports that honor our culture and traditions.

Here are some options to consider:

* **Community-based:** Reach out to your local Elders, spiritual leaders, or traditional healing circles for guidance and support. They can connect you with trusted counselors or healers who understand your needs.
* **Land-based:** Spend time in nature, just like our ancestors did. Take a walk on the prairies, breathe in some fresh air, and find peace in the land. You can also try outdoor activities like hunting or fishing (with proper training and safety measures).
* **Telehealth:** If you're unable to leave your home, we have low-bandwidth telehealth options available. These services are staffed by Indigenous counselors who understand our unique experiences.

Remember, it's okay to ask for help. If you're feeling overwhelmed or in crisis, call the Crisis Line at 1-800-588-1135 (24/7). Don't hesitate to reach out to your healthcare provider if you need immediate support."

You can also try telehealth services, which use low-bandwidth technology so you can stay connected from the comfort of your own home.

Remember, it's always okay to ask for help when you need it. If you're experiencing thoughts of self-harm or suicide, please call the Crisis Line at 1-877-470-2200 or text 686868. If you're in immediate danger, go to your nearest emergency room. You are not alone, and there are people who care about you deeply."
